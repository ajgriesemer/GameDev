# GameDev


###Getting Started
Download the cross platlform [Unity Game engine](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download?ref=personal) and open an existing project with the [Joust](https://github.com/ajgriesemer/GameDev/tree/master/Joust) folder. After the project is loaded in Unity, navigate to File > Open Scene and select the [Menu Scene](https://github.com/ajgriesemer/GameDev/blob/master/Joust/Assets/Scenes/MenuScene.unity). Hitting play should start the game as well as open up an AirConsole window in chrome with two emulated controllers. Once both players are ready, the game will begin!
